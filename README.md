# Pokepedia
    A web application engineered to be a Pokemon Encyclopedia that parses through  
    the Pokemon API and displays each pocket monster's specific information and  
    statistics.

# What I Learned
    * Created react app with multiple views
    * Practice API integration
    * Update UI with fetch calls to obtain and display API data
    * Parse JSON data
    * Search bar and search filtering

# User Experience Guide 
    Users can either use this application on their own accord and follow  
    their own decisions or use this comprehensive guide:
    * Users can use the search bar and search pokemon by ID or name.  
    (Ex: 'charizard', 'pikachu', or '6', '25')
    * When searched, users can see information based on the pokemon. 
    * Users can click the 'save' button to add the pokemon to their list.  
    (IMPORTANT: Keep in mind this list will reset when you refresh the page!)
    * Users can hover over and click the 'View' tab to switch to the list UI.
    * Enjoy the App! :)
